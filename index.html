hey here's a list of sketches i made in the beginning of 2014 while experimenting
with processing. they all use <a href="http://processingjs.org/">processing.js</a>. 
there is a link to the source underneath each sketch. for now they are 
listed in chronological order as I've moved along.

<dl>

	<dt>
		<a href="rainbow">rainbow burst</a>
		<dd>draws thousands of randomly colored lines starting at random 
		positions and terminating at the current pointer location. 
		(warning: this might be somewhat GPU intensive? it's super chunky on 
		my netbook at 1000x1000)

	<dt>
	 <a href="flashyRect">flashy perspective rectangles</a>
   <dd>draws randomly colored rectangles whose sizes change based on the
	     position of the mouse as you click and drag the pointer around.
			 this gives the illusion of perspective, though is not very accurate.

	<dt>
	 <a href="gradientSlide">gradient slider</a>
   <dd>Using HSB colormode, the position of the mouse uses the horizontal axis
	 to set brightness (100->0), and the vertical axis to set hue(360->0).
	 Possible additions to this might be adding a "z-axis" for saturation
	 using a click-and-drag slider as well as adding displays of the current
	 values or sliders.
			 
	<dt>
   <a href="squishyTyper">squishy typer</a>
	 <dd>this is just a simple way of testing out the text() method. it just
	     prints keyboard input to the screen with really bad kerning.
			 
	<dt>
   <a href="greyTriangles">grey triangle barrage</a>
	 <dd>this just creates an endless number of randomly sized and randomly
	     shaded triangles. it was created in experimenting for the next
			 sketch. So far I really enjoy staring at randomness. It's like
			 watching a fire i suppose. In the future I hope to start aiming
			 these generative sketches towards a goal with some sort of genetic
			 algorithm.

	<dt>
   <a href="sunset">sunset behind mountains</a>
	 <dd>a still picture of the sun setting behind some mountains. I had the
	 cascades in mind when i made this. it takes a second to load. alternate
	 title: fun with gradients.

	<dt>
   <a href="riding">riding for the feeling</a>
	 <dd> I was just watching
	    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYg6eIH7qR8&list=RD6gRheCFcllA">this video</a> and i realized that 1) it looked similar to the
			sketch i had made of the sunset behind some mountains and 2) that
			it seemed like a perfect progression from that sketch. I created a 
			'mountain' class for this sketch. An endless stream of mountains
			get added to an arraylist and then we iterate through the list and
			update positions. I made a <a href="riding/perspective.html">second version</a>
			of this sketch that has two mountain lists and uses the 'speed' field in the mountain class
			to create the illusion of parralax. at some point I might make a 
			third list. also my skier is ugly. i'll swap it out sometime.

	<dt>
   <a href="etchasketch">an etchasketch</a>
	 <dd>press d to clear the screen.


	<dt>
   <a href="quadshift">quadrant shifter</a>
	 <dd>shifts behavior based on which quadrant of the canvas the shifter is
	 in. right now the only change is the background. eventually this will do
	 more.

	<dt>
   <a href="pendulum">pendulums</a>
	 <dd>a number of ball that swings back and forth on a pendulum. the speed
	 of the ball object needs to be messed with in order for this to feel
	 more realistic. i never took a proper physics class. :( I made the amplitude
	 on both axes variable just to have some fun. not exactly a pendulum.
	<dt>
   <a href="gearsmash">gear smash</a>
	 <dd>These were supposed to be gears but I didn't want to bother with 
	 a custom shape. I suppose I could have used an image and rotated it.
	 Maybe later. Mostly this was just experimenting with radians. Using
	 the distance from the center on a particular axis seems useful.
	<dt>
   <a href="webtest">webtest</a>
	 <dd>testing the integration of javascript in html pages with a sketch.
	 the two html elements below the sketch can control the shade of the
	 canvas. this is great because it means we can get all sorts of 
	 interaction with processing.js that goes beyond processing's inputs.
	<dt>
   <a href="shiftingbits">shifting bits</a>
	 <dd>I'm not sure what this is now. I had an idea in my head and then
	 it went sideways but I sorta like what this becomes. it gets weird if 
	 you watch it long enough. Gonna abandon it at this point.
	<dt>
   <a href="rgbshift">rgb shift</a>
	 <dd>This page actually just contains a gif I made using 3 images
		that I created in a processing sketch. The code I used to shift the
		rgb values of each pixel is linked below the image. the 3 images just
		contain rgb values in the following order (r,g,b), (g,b,r), and (b,r,g).
		<a href=rgbshift/fordy.jpg>this</a> is the original image (the first 
		of the 3 frames).
