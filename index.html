hey here's a list of sketches i made in the beginning of 2014 while experimenting
with processing. they all use <a href="http://processingjs.org/">processing.js</a>. 
there is a link to the source underneath each sketch. for now they are 
listed in chronological order as I've moved along.
<dl>
	<dt>
		<a href="rainbow">rainbow burst</a>
		<dd>draws thousands of randomly colored lines starting at random 
		positions and terminating at the current pointer location. 
		(warning: this might be somewhat GPU intensive? it's super chunky on 
		my netbook at 1000x1000)
	<dt>
	 <a href="flashyRect">flashy perspective rectangles</a>
   <dd>draws randomly colored rectangles whose sizes change based on the
	     position of the mouse as you click and drag the pointer around.
			 this gives the illusion of perspective, though is not very accurate.
	<dt>
	 <a href="gradientSlide">gradient slider</a>
   <dd>Using HSB colormode, the position of the mouse uses the horizontal axis
	 to set brightness (100->0), and the vertical axis to set hue(360->0).
	 Possible additions to this might be adding a "z-axis" for saturation
	 using a click-and-drag slider as well as adding displays of the current
	 values or sliders.
			 
	<dt>
   <a href="squishyTyper">squishy typer</a>
	 <dd>this is just a simple way of testing out the text() method. it just
	     prints keyboard input to the screen with really bad kerning.
			 
	<dt>
   <a href="greyTriangles">grey triangle barrage</a>
	 <dd>this just creates an endless number of randomly sized and randomly
	     shaded triangles. it was created in experimenting for the next
			 sketch. So far I really enjoy staring at randomness. It's like
			 watching a fire i suppose. In the future I hope to start aiming
			 these generative sketches towards a goal with some sort of genetic
			 algorithm.
	<dt>
   <a href="sunset">sunset behind mountains</a>
	 <dd>a still picture of the sun setting behind some mountains. I had the
	 cascades in mind when i made this. it takes a second to load. alternate
	 title: fun with gradients.
	<dt>
   <a href="riding">riding for the feeling</a>
	 <dd> I was just watching
	    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYg6eIH7qR8&list=RD6gRheCFcllA">this video</a> and i realized that 1) it looked similar to the
			sketch i had made of the sunset behind some mountains and 2) that
			it seemed like a perfect progression from that sketch. I'm not sure
			what the best practices are for animating the triangles onto and
			off of the canvas, but I can think of a couple ways off hand..
